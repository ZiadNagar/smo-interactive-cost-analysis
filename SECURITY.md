## Security Considerations

This application processes financial and medical cost data. While it runs entirely in the browser and doesn't store or transmit sensitive data to external servers, users should be aware of:

1. **Local Data**: All calculations are performed locally in the browser
2. **No Data Transmission**: No personal or calculation data is sent to external servers
3. **Browser Security**: Ensure you're using an up-to-date, secure browser
4. **Local Storage**: The application may use browser local storage for user preferences

## Best Practices for Users

1. Use the application on secure, trusted devices
2. Keep your browser updated
3. Be cautious when sharing calculation results that may contain sensitive cost information
4. Clear browser data if using on shared computers
